        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 3 (8-inch) round cake pans with cooking spray, and line bottoms with parchment.</li>
            <li>Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk together sugar, 2 cups mashed banana, oil, yogurt, buttermilk, vanilla, and eggs in a second bowl until well blended; add to flour mixture and stir just until combined. Divide batter evenly between prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick is inserted and comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool in pans on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans to a wire rack cool completely, about 1 to1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile for the caramel sauce, combine sugar, cream, butter, cinnamon and salt in a small saucepan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until butter is melted and sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.

            <li>Place sliced bananas in a small bowl and drizzle with 4 tablespoons of the caramel sauce and remaining 1 tablespoon rum; toss gently to coat. Cool remaining caramel sauce to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>For the caramel frosting, beat butter in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium speed until light in color, about 3 minutes. Gradually add powdered sugar, and beat on medium speed for about 3 minutes until light and fluffy. Add 1 cup of the salted banana caramel sauce, and beat on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Transfer 1 cup frosting to a piping bag fitted with a #12 tip.</li>

            <li>Spoon half of sliced banana mixture inside frosting ring and spread evenly. Top with second cake layer.</li>
            <li>Spread another 2/3 cup caramel frosting over second layer. Repeat with piping bag to pipe a ring of caramel frosting around outer edge of cake layer on top of frosting.</li>
            <li>Spoon remaining sliced banana mixture inside frosting ring and spread evenly. Top with remaining cake layer.</li>
            <li>Spread remaining frosting on top and sides of cake and smooth.</li>
